## Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks
- **E-prescribing certification fails** → Start early, hire consultant if needed
- **AI hallucinations** → Always require provider review, extensive testing
- **Scaling issues** → Cloud-native architecture, load testing

### Business Risks
- **Practice Fusion improves** → They haven't in 3 years, unlikely
- **Can't get customers** → Free trial, easy migration, great support
- **Competitive pricing** → Compete on value (AI), not just price

---

## Decision Point

**Should you build this?**

✅ **YES if:**
- You can commit 6 months and $200K budget
- You have or can hire the team
- You believe in the AI advantage
- You're willing to provide great support

⚠️ **MAYBE if:**
- Budget is tight → Build in phases, start with e-prescribing
- Small team → Focus on core features, skip nice-to-haves
- Uncertain → Build MVP in 3 months, get 3 pilot practices

❌ **NO if:**
- Can't commit minimum 6 months
- No budget for development
- Don't want to do customer support
