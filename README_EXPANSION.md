## 🚦 Decision Framework

### Should You Proceed?

**YES, if:**
- ✅ You have $150K+ available for initial investment
- ✅ You're committed to 6-12 month timeline
- ✅ You have or can hire technical team
- ✅ Providers are experiencing documentation burnout
- ✅ You're losing revenue to coding inaccuracies
- ✅ You want competitive advantage in your market

**MAYBE, start smaller if:**
- ⚠️ Budget is tight (<$100K available)
- ⚠️ Need to prove ROI first
- ⚠️ Limited technical resources
- ⚠️ Uncertain about AI adoption

**In "MAYBE" case:**
- Start with Phase 1, Week 1-2 only ($20K)
- Build clinical note summarization
- Measure impact for 4 weeks
- Then decide on full buildout

**NO (for now), if:**
- ❌ Practice is financially unstable
- ❌ Major operational issues to fix first
- ❌ No technical resources available
- ❌ Providers resistant to any change
- ❌ Other major IT projects in progress
